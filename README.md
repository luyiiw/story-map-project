## Content Overview

This project is an interactive story map designed to guide first-time visitors through a curated one-day walking itinerary in Philadelphia. The StoryMap presents a sequence of stops organized by **morning**, **afternoon**, and **evening**, highlighting cultural institutions, historic landmarks, public spaces, and local food recommendations.

Each slide includes:

* A short description of a featured location
* A clickable map view with markers
* Custom walking paths connecting each stop
* Relevant images, links, and additional context

The experience begins at **30th Street Station** and concludes at **Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell**, offering a complete and realistic one-day sightseeing route through Center City and Old City.

**Target audience:**
Visitors with limited time (one day) to explore Philadelphia who want a guided, walkable, and visually engaging introduction to major attractions, food stops, and historic sites.
